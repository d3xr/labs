# Software Testing

Software testing is a process where we check that a software program works as expected. It's important because it helps us find errors or bugs in the software before it is delivered to users.

There are different types of software testing:

1. **Unit Testing**: This is when we test individual components of a program in isolation. This can help us find issues with the specific parts of the program. For example, in a calculator program, we might test the "add" function by itself to make sure it correctly adds numbers.

2. **Integration Testing**: This is when we test how different parts of a program work together. This can help us find issues that arise when different components interact. Continuing with the calculator example, we might test that the "add" and "subtract" functions work correctly together.

3. **System Testing**: This is when we test a complete system to validate that it meets the specified requirements. This helps us to find issues in the entire application flow and can be used to verify that the system works correctly as a whole.

In software development, we often use frameworks and tools to help us write and run tests. These can automate the process of testing and make it more efficient. Examples of these tools include Junit for Java and pytest for Python.

Remember, the goal of software testing is to improve the quality of software and deliver a product that meets the user's expectations.
