# Debugging

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing problems (bugs) in a software program. The code I chose for debugging is a simple Python program that calculates the factorial of a number.

Here's the buggy code:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```


The bug is in the base case of the recursive function. When n is 0, the function should return 1 (since the factorial of 0 is 1), not 0.

Here's how I debugged it:

I first ran the code with an input of 0, and the output was 0, which was incorrect.
I reviewed the code and identified the base case in the recursive function as a potential issue.
I changed the return value of the base case from 0 to 1.
Here's the fixed code:

```def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```


Debugging tools can be very helpful. They allow us to step through the code line by line and monitor the values of variables. This can make it easier to identify the cause of a bug.
