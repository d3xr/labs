# Docker and Docker Compose Installation

In this document, I describe the steps I took to install Docker and Docker Compose on my MacOS system.

## Docker Installation

First, I installed Docker. Here are the steps that I followed:

1. I downloaded Docker Desktop for Mac from the Docker Hub website.
2. Once the Docker.dmg file finished downloading, I double-clicked it to open the installer.
3. After the installer window opened, I dragged the Docker icon to my Applications folder.
4. I then opened Docker Desktop by double-clicking the application in the Applications folder.

After these steps, Docker was installed on my Mac. I confirmed this by opening a terminal window and typing `docker --version`, which showed me the installed version of Docker.

## Docker Compose Installation

Docker Compose came preinstalled with Docker Desktop on Mac, so I didn't need to perform any extra steps to install it. I confirmed that Docker Compose was installed by opening a terminal window and typing `docker-compose --version`, which displayed the installed version of Docker Compose.

## Observations

The installation process was pretty straightforward because the Docker Desktop installer does all the necessary setup. Since Docker Compose comes preinstalled with Docker Desktop for Mac, I didn't need to go through additional steps to get it set up. This definitely made the process easier for me. So far, I haven't encountered any issues, and everything seems to be working as expected.
