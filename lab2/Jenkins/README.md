### Tool 2: Jenkins

**What is Jenkins?**

Jenkins is a tool that helps with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). It means that Jenkins can automatically build, test, and deploy code.

**Why is Jenkins important in DevOps?**

Jenkins can automate many tasks. This makes the software development process faster and more reliable.

**Key Features of Jenkins**

- Pipeline: This is a set of steps that Jenkins follows to build, test, and deploy code.
- Plugins: Jenkins has many plugins to work with different tools and technologies.

**Example of Jenkins in Use**

Suppose a company is developing a mobile app. They can use Jenkins to automatically build and test the app every time a developer pushes code. If the build and tests are successful, Jenkins can also deploy the app to the app store.
