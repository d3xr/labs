3. Sometimes, a feature works well in development but breaks in production. This happens because the environments are different.

## How DevOps can Help

### Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

### Communication and Collaboration

## Conclusion

DevOps can solve many problems in ABC Software Company. It can make deployment faster, environments the same, and improve communication. This means that ABC can deliver better software and make their customers happy.
